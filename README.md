This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A home assigment from a job iterview.

The app playes 8 different music tracks that combine to one song.
You are able to play, pause, stop and loop all tracks, or mute any track you choose seperatly.
The prograss bar moves along with the song and you are able to use it to change the song current time.
